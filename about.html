						I <span class="highlight">started learning Java</span> when I was in selected my main stream
						subjects and at that time I didn't really knew about what
						I was doing before I was always interested in learning about computers and technologies but not
						to
						the extend I actually
						did in the future. <span class="highlight">I'm a self taught developer</span> and I know what
						its
						like to not have anyone to guide us through our
						career or passion but that was okay for me as I was a very introvert kind of person or in other
						language a very
						extremely shy person. Now I know its very unreal when people say they're shy or anything like
						that
						specially guys but
						I'm like that and I don't have any reason for it. It is what it is and <span class="highlight">
							I don't trade off my passion and personality for anything.</span>

						<h2>My Passion</h2>
						<p>
							Programming is my passion and I'll try my best that it stays my passion and never becomes a
							burden on me
						</p>
					</section>
					<div class="secondSection">
						<p class="aboutContent">
							My passion is programming and making new projects and I can do that all day long sometimes I
							don't even sleep at night
							because its not just my passion its kind of a obsession for me I'm obsessed with my work and
							everything about it unlike
							other kids or men ( I don't really know which category ) who likes to play games. Some
							people say why not set every
							skill to 100% when you know most of it but that's not my thinking I would probably sit at
							home and do nothing rather.
							Reason is because the day I set any of my skills to 100% I'm gonna stop trying to learn more
							about it and I never wanna
							do that I wanna keep going until they come up with virtual computers and actual
							computational grows so much that even
							terabytes of storage seems like megabytes or less.
